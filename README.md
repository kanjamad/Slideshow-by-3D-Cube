# CUBE CSS-3D
* This Project I'll create slideshow represented by 3D cube.
* Project will be based on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### HTML structure
The cube has six divs (or “sides”), absolutely positioned. The class names correspond to the initial positions of the sides (back, left, right, top, bottom, front).

### Viewport Width and Height (vw) 
- Allow us to make CUPE responsive in a very flexible way. For example if width of viewport is decreased then size of height will be decreased accordingly. So if we make windows small then we will see that width and height of viewport are decreasing accordingly.
